# 🔧 Features

### 🛒 Dynamic Menu System
Add, update, and delete menu items via a user-friendly GUI. Items support custom descriptions, images, pricing, and categories.

### 👤 Customer, Employee & Admin Interfaces
Three distinct role-based interfaces:
- **Customers** can browse the storefront, add items to their cart, and place orders.
- **Employees** can log in and update the order status of placed orders.
- **Admins** have full access to manage the menu, view orders, and configure user roles.

### 📦 Order Management
Customers can place orders in real-time. Employees can update order progress (e.g., "In Progress", "Completed"), and Admins have full oversight of all orders and system activity.

### 🔐 Secure Authentication
User accounts are protected with hashed passwords and session-based authentication. Role-specific access ensures secure operations across all interfaces.
